<h1 align="center">Welcome to SAH</h1>

<p align="center"><b><i>An open-source programming language</b></i></p>

## Description
SAH is a simplified version of seeing code in its overall. By simplyfing the syntax, it allows you, the developer, to turn your ideas into code easier than ever thought possible before.

## Development
SAH is, at the moment, very early in development and we're still debating on certain features. It has, however, gone beyond the brainstorming phase and some code is already being written.
